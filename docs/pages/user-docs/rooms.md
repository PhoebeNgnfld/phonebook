# Rooms
When you open the room subpage you can directly open our internal **booking tool** and check for available facilities as in Outlook. 

To find a specific room, you need to navigate either via the column at the left side or by clicking the buttons displayed in the middle.

At the next deeper level you find **contact information** for the whole location you selected and the option to open it in **Google Maps**.

If you go further you can select a **floor** and than a specific **room**.
